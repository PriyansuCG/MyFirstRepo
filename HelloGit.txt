Hello Git: A Beginner's Tutorial on Git and GitLab



Introduction


This tutorial is for beginners who are new to Git and GitLab .

Git is a "free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency." Use Git locally on your computer to manage software versions.

GitLab is a DevOps platform. It can host your local Git repos for remote collaboration, and a whole lot more. Some other Git servers are GitHub and Bitbucket.

Register for a GitLab account here or on your private GitLab server.
From a web browser, log into your GitLab account.
Create a new repo:

Create a new project: https://gitlab.com/projects/new
Click Create blank project.
Project name: hello-world
Click the Create project button.
Your remote GitLab repo is created.
